# Outlier Detection with K-Means Clustering

## Project Overview

This project performs cluster analysis to detect outliers within a dataset using K-Means clustering. Utilizing Python libraries such as NumPy, Scikit-learn, and Matplotlib, the analysis identifies anomalies that could impact decision-making across various domains, including finance and healthcare.

## Key Features

- **K-Means Clustering**: Applies K-Means clustering algorithm to group data and detect outliers.
- **Data Visualization**: Uses Matplotlib to visualize clustering results and outlier detection.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Programming language for analysis and modeling.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Development environment for interactive computing.
- **NumPy**: Library for numerical operations and data manipulation.
- **Matplotlib**: Plotting library for visualizing data.
- **Scikit-learn**: Machine learning library for clustering algorithms.

## How to Run

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/francisojeah/Clustered-Outlier-Detection.git
   cd Clustered-Outlier-Detection
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**
   - Ensure you have the necessary Python packages installed. You can use a virtual environment or directly install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install numpy matplotlib scikit-learn
   ```

3. **Open the Jupyter Notebook**
   - Launch Jupyter Notebook and open `outlier_detection.ipynb`


4. **Run the Notebook**
   - Execute the cells in the notebook to perform the cluster analysis and visualize results.
